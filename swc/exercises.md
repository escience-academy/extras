## The Unix Shell
### End of Section 02 "Navigating Files and Directories"

> ### Exercise: write down all adverbs to `ls` that you think you will use regularly.
>
> > ### Solution
> > Most likely you will include `-l` for the long listing format because one file per line is often easier to read.
> > 
> > Also `-t` is frequently used for time ordering to show the file you edited last first, or at the top (in combination
> > with `-l`).
> > 
> > `-a` also shows hidden files (starting with `.`), so that may turn out useful every now and then.
